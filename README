### IKAWA EMULATOR

A python app that implements some of the protocol of IKAWA roasting system.

This is very basic and does serve as a basis to understand the IKAWA bluetooth protocol. It is by no means production ready and should be used with caution.

## Installation

I used libprotoc 3.12.4, but 3.19 should be better
protoc -I=./ --python_out=./ ./IkawaCmd.protc

if you are having issues with the prtoc version try:

export PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION=python

## Running

python pySimIkawa.py

Connect with IkawaMonitor APP or with the official app to this emulated roaster.

To start roasting create an empty file under the same running directory. This is equivalent to pressing the button on the IKAWA roaster.

touch simulate

The emulator will reply with a recorded session. In this repository you'll find an example : sim_session_exp3_feb26.csv

Once the session has been completed the file is removed. The emulator runs faster than the actual IKAWA, see the code to change this behaviour.
